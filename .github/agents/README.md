# GitHub Agents Configuration

This directory is a placeholder for future GitHub-native agent configurations.

## Purpose

As GitHub expands its AI agent capabilities, this directory will contain configuration files for:
- Copilot Workspace settings
- Agent-specific permissions
- Custom agent definitions
- Workflow automation rules

## Current Status

No agent configurations are currently defined. This directory serves as a reserved location for future GitHub agent features.
